#ClearPendingTitles

.CIA/.3dsx app that uses am:u to clear pending title installations for NAND and SD. Nothing special.

## Compilation

Requires ctrulib, makerom, and bannertool. Running "make" will generate an installable CIA as well as a .3dsx and .smdh for the HBL (requires am:u access, i.e. an arm11 kernel exploit).
